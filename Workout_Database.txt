Fitness Wizard will have four different categrories of workouts that the user can select from and each exericse will have different tempos (the speed at which you perform each phase of an exercise.).

Tempos will be in an array of sets of '3 0 2', '2 2 2', '4 1 1', '5 3 1', '1 0 1', '3 2 1', '2 1 1'
Example: '3 0 2'

3 (Eccentric Phase): This number indicates the duration in seconds for the eccentric phase, which is the lowering or lengthening phase of the exercise.

0 (Pause): This indicates a pause or hold at the midpoint of the exercise movement. In some tempos, this might be noted as "X" or "pause". In the case of 0, it means there's no specific pause at this phase.

2 (Concentric Phase): This number indicates the duration in seconds for the concentric phase, which is the lifting or shortening phase of the exercise. For a squat, this would be the time it takes to stand back up.

Individual, Bro Split, Upper Lower, BodyBuilder Split

Individual selection will target muscle groups of biceps, triceps, chest, back, shoulders, quads, hamstring, glutes, calves, and abs

Bro Split selection will be broken apart into three sub sections
1.) Push workout consisting of working out the triceps, chest, and shoulders
2.) Pull workout consisting of working out the back, shoulders, and biceps
3.) Legs workout consisting of working out the glutes, calves, hamstrings, and quads

Upper Lower selection will be broken into two selections:
1.) Upper workout consisting of the triceps, biceps, shoulders, chest, and back
2.) Lower workout consisting of the quads, calves, hamstrings, and the glutes 

In the JavaScript file ( workout_info.js ): We will have const Tempo = ['3 0 2', '2 2 2', '4 1 1', '5 3 1', '1 0 1', '3 2 1', '2 1 1']

Then possibly another an object of WORKOUTS with sub-arrays of each individual option of: Individual, Bro Split, Upper Lower, BodyBuilder Split with the corresponding muscle group the user wants to train.

Something like this possibly 

export const WORKOUT = {
      bro_split :{
              pull: ['back', 'shoulders', 'biceps'],
              legs: ['glutes', 'calves', 'hamstrings', 'quads']
               push: ['triceps', 'chest', 'shoulders'],
      }
}
